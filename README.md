# CHANGELOG
[CHANGELOG.MD](CHANGELOG.md)

# History
Many years, I used for developing beautiful Sublime Text, different versions with Monokai theme. After I had started using vscode, I found that default syntax highlighting is little bit different from ST3. So, I developed this extension to fix it.

# Docs & Contribute  
To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code. But I suggest you to use official Marketplace inside vscode. Go to [VS code Marketplace](https://TODO)

Yep, I can made a mistakes in code or this file and so on. I used to vscode for web developing, writing scripts (Bash, PowerShall) and some experiments with other languages. Sorry, but I can't check all programming languages in the world.

So, if you would have any comment or suggest or you find bugs, I would be happy received pull-request for you. Or, you can create issue and even send me email? and we try to find solutions.

# Tweaks
